      Ameelio, Inc. (“Ameelio”, “Company”, “we”, “our”, and “us”) has created a communication service (collectively referred to as “Services”) to connect individuals who are incarcerated with the free world to improve the lives of those impacted by incarceration and reduce recidivism rates. Ameelio also researches and studies prisons and prison systems and institutions, the institutions of the criminal justice system, and criminal justice policies to understand the impact of incarceration.
